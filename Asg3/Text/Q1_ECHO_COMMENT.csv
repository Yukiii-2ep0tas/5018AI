LOVE OUR NEW ECHO!
I'll never know how I survived before Alexa...
I've had it for about 3 months. I mostly use it as an easy-to-set timer & to add items to my grocery list.
No home is complete without an Echo (Alexa) Good Job Amazon !!!
I have several Alexa/Echo's and the 1st generation is still the best.
I just received it packaging was great no damage was easy to set up and use
My echo is loud and deaf
Good for information but a little limited on what she can tell you. Sound quality is only ok.
Alexia is NOT a Classical music fan.
Echo is a growing obsession
This is the best present I ever bought myself. It does almost everything. I love it!
"The Amazon Echo line of Alexa enabled devices are great, but the Alexa service itself leave a lot to be desired, making the Amazon Echo devices not as useful or valuable as you might originally think."
